This error occurs when using the Expo Go app to test your React Native application.  The error message itself might vary, but it generally indicates that Expo Go is having trouble communicating with your development server or loading necessary resources.  It may manifest as a blank screen, a generic error message, or a specific error related to a missing module or network issue.  This is often due to issues with your development environment, network connectivity, or problems with the Expo client itself.
