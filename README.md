# Expo Go App Loading Failure

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Expo Go: failure to load a React Native application. The problem manifests as a blank screen or a generic error message within the Expo Go client. This README outlines the issue, provides a sample application exhibiting the problem, and offers a potential solution.

## Problem Description

When attempting to run a React Native project using Expo Go, the app fails to load.  Instead of the expected application, a blank screen, a network error, or a generic error message is displayed. This can occur due to several factors, including network connectivity problems, incorrect development server configuration, or issues within the Expo Go client itself.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Start the development server using `npm start`.
4. Open Expo Go and scan the QR code.
5. Observe that the application fails to load as expected, instead showing a blank screen or an error message.

## Solution

The solution typically involves carefully checking your network connection, ensuring your development server is running correctly, and verifying that Expo Go is properly configured.  Common fixes include:

* **Checking Network Connectivity:** Ensure you have a stable internet connection and that your device (the one running Expo Go) is connected to the same network as your development machine.
* **Restarting Development Server:** Stop and restart your development server. 
* **Verifying Development Server Address:**  Double-check that your development server's address is correctly configured in Expo Go (if applicable).
* **Updating Expo Go:** Update Expo Go to the latest version.
* **Reinstalling Expo Client:**  Try reinstalling the Expo Go application on your device.
* **Checking for Firewall Issues:** Ensure that no firewall is blocking communication between Expo Go and your development server.
